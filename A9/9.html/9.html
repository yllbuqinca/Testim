         <h2>Security!</h2>
        <p>I'm in my room, talk to the walls <br>
            I hear them sing, la-la-la-la <br>
            Falling backwards into the dark<br>
            I hear the voices talk so loud<br>
            Carry me softly, pull me down<br>
            I shut my eyes, cover my mouth<br>
            Tell me how?<br>
            Something so beautiful can taste so foul<br>
            So foul<br>
            Something beautiful can taste so foul<br>
            Look around<br>
            Something beautiful can seem so<br>
            Worthless<br>
            Worthless<br>
            Worthless<br>
            Worthless<br>
            Security<br>

            One o'clock, 2 AM to 6 in the morning<br>
            One o'clock, 2 AM, I don't recognize myself<br>
            Now every time I close my eyes I see the corpses<br>
            Every time I look in the mirror I see monsters<br>
            One o'clock, 2 AM to 6 in the morning<br>
            I can’t hear my thoughts over this running water<br>
            Every time I look in the mirror I feel nauseous<br>
            Every time I look in the mirror I see monsters<br>
            What would you ask if you had one wish?<br>
            If you could choose only one thing to fix?<br>
            If you had the chance, would you change something?<br>
            You could lose yourself, would you take that risk?<br>
            What would you ask if you had one wish?<br>

            So beautiful, so perfect<br>
            So beautiful, so perfect,<br>
            So beautiful, so perfect<br>
            So beautiful, so perfect<br>
            Perfect<br>
            Security, perfect<br>
            How did you get so perfect?<br>
            I wish that I was perfect<br>
            You make me feel so dirty<br>
            You make me feel so naked<br>
            Oh, I know it's worth it<br>
            I want to see you waste it<br>
            I want to be perfect<br>
            You make it look so perfect<br>
            Security, perfect<br>
            I know I'll never be perfect<br>
